# Memory-Game

This is  a classic memory card game that includes offline&online modes,
It lets the user play by himself with the option to set the time for each game, or he can challenge a friend to 
an online session where the winner is the one with the most points at the end of the game.

You can choose the game theme from a selection of famous TV shows like Family Guy, The Simpsons, Rick&Morty and more.
Each theme has its own music and card photos.
Also, the user can upload his/her profile pic for others to see when playing online.
The user can control sound, music, and vibration through the settings menu.

The main tool I used for this app is Google's Firebase for registering new users to the app, Saving their info,
And for the online session game.

Also, I used Node.js in order to send push notifications of game requests between devices when app in in background or in forground.

I know that using Firebase for the online feature is probably not the best way but I used 
the tools that I know so far to make this app work.
